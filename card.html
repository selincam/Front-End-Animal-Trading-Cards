				<li><span>Habitat.</span>: Sea</li>
				<li><span>Nutritional</span>: Carnivores</li>
				<li><span>Average IQ of a dolphin</span>: An appropriate IQ test to measure dolphin intelligence does not exist. This measurement suggests the higher the number, the greater the intelligence. The human EQ is 7.0. The EQ for great apes, elephants, chimpanzees and whales is about 1.8-2.3, meaning they have smaller brains for their body size than do humans.</li>
				<li><span>Can a dolphin survive on land?</span>: Yes, even though dolphins and whales are mammals who breathe air, they need the support of the water to carry their body weight. While they can survive for a matter of hours or even a few days on land, they cannot survive indefinitely out of the water or the weight of their bodies may crush their organs.</li>

			<p class="information">Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Cetaceans' closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.</p>
